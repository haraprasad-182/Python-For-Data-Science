    "### ✅ 1. Introduction to Control Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are control structures?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're following a recipe. You don't always just go straight from the first step to the last. Sometimes you need to check if an ingredient is ready before adding it (a decision), or maybe you need to stir something for 5 minutes (repetition).\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, **control structures** are like the recipe's special instructions. They allow you to control the *flow* of your program's execution. Instead of just running code line-by-line from top to bottom, control structures let you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Make Decisions:** Execute certain blocks of code only if specific conditions are met.\n",
    "2.  **Repeat Actions:** Execute a block of code multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we need decision-making in programs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs need to react differently based on different situations, inputs, or internal states. Without decision-making, a program would do the exact same thing every time it runs. Decision-making allows programs to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interactive:** Respond differently to user input (e.g., correct vs. incorrect password).\n",
    "*   **Adaptive:** Handle various data scenarios (e.g., process positive numbers differently than negative ones).\n",
    "*   **Robust:** Manage errors or special cases gracefully.\n",
    "*   **Efficient:** Perform actions only when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about simple things:\n",
    "*   Does the user want to save the file? (Yes/No decision)\n",
    "*   Is the entered username correct? (Yes/No decision)\n",
    "*   Is the number even or odd? (Two different paths)\n",
    "*   Is the temperature too high, too low, or just right? (Multiple possible paths)\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision-making is fundamental to creating useful and intelligent programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 2. Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements allow your program to execute specific blocks of code based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`if` statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Executes a block of code *only if* a specified condition is `True`.\n",
    "*   **Syntax:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        # Code to execute if condition is True\n",
    "        # This block MUST be indented\n",
    "    # Code here runs regardless (it's outside the if block)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    age = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "    if age >= 18:\n",
    "        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\") # This line runs because 20 >= 18 is True\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Program continues...\") # This line runs always\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**`if-else` statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Executes one block of code if a condition is `True` and a *different* block if the condition is `False`. It provides an alternative path.\n",
    "*   **Syntax:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        # Code to execute if condition is True\n",
    "        # Indented block\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Code to execute if condition is False\n",
    "        # Indented block\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    temperature = 15\n",
    "\n",
    "    if temperature > 25:\n",
    "        print(\"It's a hot day!\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"It's not a hot day.\") # This line runs because 15 > 25 is False\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Weather check complete.\") # This line runs always\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**`if-elif-else` ladder**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Used when you need to check multiple conditions in sequence. Python checks each condition (`if`, then `elif`, then `elif`...) until it finds one that is `True`. It executes the corresponding block and then skips the rest of the ladder (including the final `else`). If *none* of the `if` or `elif` conditions are `True`, the `else` block (if present) is executed.\n",
    "*   **Syntax:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if condition1:\n",
    "        # Code for condition1 True\n",
    "    elif condition2:\n",
    "        # Code for condition2 True (only checked if condition1 was False)\n",
    "    elif condition3:\n",
    "        # Code for condition3 True (only checked if condition1 and condition2 were False)\n",
    "    # ... potentially more elif statements\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Code to execute if ALL preceding conditions were False\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **Example:** (Grading System)\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    score = 75\n",
    "\n",
    "    if score >= 90:\n",
    "        grade = \"A\"\n",
    "    elif score >= 80:\n",
    "        grade = \"B\"\n",
    "    elif score >= 70:\n",
    "        grade = \"C\" # This condition is True (75 >= 70)\n",
    "    elif score >= 60:\n",
    "        grade = \"D\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        grade = \"F\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(f\"Your score is {score}, which corresponds to grade {grade}.\") # Output: Your score is 75, which corresponds to grade C.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    *Key point:* Even though `75 >= 60` is also true, the `elif score >= 70:` block was executed first, and the rest of the ladder was skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nested conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Placing one conditional statement inside another. This allows for more complex decision-making based on multiple levels of checks.\n",
    "*   **Syntax:** Indentation is crucial to show which `if`/`else` belongs to which level.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if outer_condition:\n",
    "        # Code for outer condition True\n",
    "        if inner_condition:\n",
    "            # Code for both outer and inner conditions True\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            # Code for outer True, but inner False\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Code for outer condition False\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **Example:** (User Access Control)\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    is_logged_in = True\n",
    "    is_admin = False\n",
    "\n",
    "    if is_logged_in:\n",
    "        print(\"Welcome!\")\n",
    "        if is_admin:\n",
    "            print(\"Admin privileges granted.\")\n",
    "        else:\n",

    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Please log in to access the system.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-life examples summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Grading system:** Using `if-elif-else` to assign grades based on scores.\n",
    "*   **User access control:** Using `if` (and potentially nested `if`) to check login status and user roles (admin, guest, standard user).\n",
    "*   **Traffic light:** `if` color is red, stop; `elif` color is yellow, prepare to stop; `else` (color is green), go.\n",
    "*   **ATM:** `if` sufficient funds, allow withdrawal; `else`, deny.\n",

    "### ✅ 3. Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are loops?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are control structures used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Instead of writing the same (or similar) code over and over again, you write it once inside a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between `for` loop and `while` loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`for` loop:** Used when you want to iterate over a *sequence* (like a list, string, or range of numbers) or any other *iterable* object. You generally know (or the sequence defines) how many times the loop will run. Think of it as \"for each item in this collection...\".\n",
    "*   **`while` loop:** Used when you want to repeat a block of code *as long as* a certain condition remains `True`. You might not know in advance how many times it will run. Think of it as \"while this condition is true...\".\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** A concise and often more readable way to create lists. They essentially combine a `for` loop (and optionally an `if` condition) into a single line. This is considered more \"Pythonic\" for simple list creation tasks.\n",
    "*   **Syntax:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
    "    # 'if condition' part is optional\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **Breakdown:**\n",
    "    1.  `expression`: What to do with each item (e.g., `item * 2`, `item.upper()`, `item`). This becomes an element in the new list.\n",
    "    2.  `for item in iterable`: A standard `for` loop header to iterate over the source sequence.\n",
    "    3.  `if condition` (Optional): Filters items from the iterable. Only items for which the condition is `True` are processed by the `expression`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Example:** (Create a list of squares)\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Traditional for loop way\n",
    "    squares_loop = []\n",
    "    for x in range(10):\n",
    "        squares_loop.append(x * x)\n",

    "    print(\"Squares of even numbers (comp):\", even_squares_comp)\n",
